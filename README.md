Triadic Closure in Two Interacting Populations
Triadic closure in dynamical networks is a powerful way to represent
real world effects of forming links, or in social settings, friendships.
We see in the real world that two people with mutual connections
are more likely to become connected themselves. This project discusses the effect that triadic closure, along with randomly formed
and lost friendships, has on a system of two interacting schools to
form a stochastic system that exhibits different behaviours depending on initial edge densities and stochastic fluctuations, treating the
students as nodes and their friendships as edges. We then view the
model from a deterministic mean field perspective, looking only at
the probability of edges in each part of the network, to show that the
steady states of this system accurately match those exhibited by the
simulations of the stochastic model. We conclude by showing how
the different parts of the network interact with each other, and discuss how accurate the model we have used may be in the real world.
